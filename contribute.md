# Contribution Guidelines

- **To add, remove, change:** Edit the `README.md` and then submit a pull request.
- Items of category should be sorted _alphabetically_.
- Each item should be limited to one link.
- The link should be the name of the project.
- The link and description are separated by a dash.
- The description starts with an uppercase character and ends with a period.
- The description should be clear, concise, and non-promotional.
- Consistent and correct naming. For example, `Node.js`, not `NodeJS` or `node.js`.

Thanks everyone!
